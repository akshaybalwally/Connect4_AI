Model this project after alphago. Obviously I don't have the computational resources, or knowledge, but I want to do something similar for connect four. Need to...
-review reinforcement learning methods for how to save state values when there are far too many to store all
-use convNet to learn on the state values that are saved. Should be computationally cheaper, and need fewer layers. Still need to get better with convNets
-need to read/get better with:
	-nature article on alphago
	-reinforcement learning barto
	-cs231n stuff

-pre-project: do this with tic tac toe, purely for didactic measures
	-skip convNet section, for obvious reasons
